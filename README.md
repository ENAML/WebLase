WebLase: Web App for Ramiel Project
===================================

Ramiel is a galvo laser image-projection system connected to web upload/drawing interface, and was my final project at Fullstack Academy.

Users can draw images on the HTML5 canvas or upload their own images, which are then stored in Node.js file system and passed to a node.js app running on the computer connected to laser hardware.

The web app is functional and connects to the laser computer running the node.js app. Thus the pipeline is fully functioning.

Unfortunately, as the laser computer and lasers themselves can't be running all the time, the app doesn't have much functionality unless we are running the laser computer.

The team is discussing putting together a gallery show and holding a galvo laser workshop utilizing Ramiel.
